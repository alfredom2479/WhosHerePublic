This is an Android Application targeted for teachers who want to take attendance using face recognition. 

This app allows a user to create and log into an account. With this account, you can create classes and within each class, you can add students to that class.

Each student is associated with a picture of their face. 

The user is able to pick a date (defaulted to the current date) for which they would like to take attendance. The user (teacher) takes a picture and uploads it to the app. All the students who have their faces in the uploaded photo will show up as present in the app. 

The user (teacher) can also modify the attendance status of each user for any given day manually.
