The Purpose of this project is to give teachers an easy and simple way to take attendance.

Firebase is used for authentication and for the NoSQL Real time database.

This Project originally had a facial recognition feature. However, in order for this feature to
work, Code that I wrote needs to be ran from a linux machine. Therefore, i removed the feature
and added a few extra things.

The "WhosHere" video is the most recent version of the project. The other videos demonstrate
the facial recognition feature which is meant to give users the ability to take attendance 
by simply taking a picture of the class and uploading it to the app.
